## Physical Attack
Physical attacks are mounted by an attacker with physical access to the CPU. SGX does not claim to defend against physical attacks such as power analysis, although there is no successful physical attacks against SGX. 

* Port Attack

Example: Cold Boot Attack (冷启动攻击)
The attacker plugs in a USB flash drive into the victim’s case and causes the computer to boot from the flash drive, whose malicious system software receives unrestricted access to the computer’s peripherals

* Bus Tapping Attacks 

Installing a device that taps a bus on the computer's motherboard. Passive attacks are limited to monitoring the bus traffic, whereas active attacks can modify the traffic, or even place new commands on the bus. 
Replaying attacks are a notoriously challenging class of active attacks, where the attacker first records the bus traffic, and then selectively replays a subset of the traffic. 

* Chip Attacks

Removing a chip's packagng and directly interacting with its electrical circuits. These attacks generally take advantage of equipment and techniques that were originally developed to diagnose design and manufacturing defects in chips.

* Power analysis attacks

The attacker takes advantage of a known correlation between power consumption and the computed data, and learns some property of the data from the observed power consumption.
In general, power attacks cannot be addressed at the architectural level, as they rely on implementation details that are decided during the manufacturing process. 

## Privileged Software Attack

SMM, the most privileged execution level, is only used to handle a specific kind of interrupts, namely System Management Interrupts (SMI). SMIs were initially designed exclusively for hardware use, and were only triggered by asserting a dedicated pin (SMI#) in the CPU’s chip package. However, in modern systems, system software can generate an SMI by using the LAPIC(Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)’s IPI(Inter-processor interrupt) mechanism. 

The SMM handler is stored in System Management RAM (SMRAM) which, in theory, is not accessible when the processor isn’t running in SMM. However, its protection mechanisms were bypassed multiple times, and SMM-based rootkits have been demonstrated. Compromising the SMM grants an attacker access to all the software on the computer, as SMM is the most privileged execution mode.

The monolithic kernal desgn leads to many opportunities for security vulnerablities in kernal code. Linux has 17 million lines of code, and hashad over 100 security vulnerabilities patched in each of the last three years (2012-2014).

## Software Attacks on Peripherals

* PCI Express Attacks

PCIe bus: The Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus that connects a CPU to peripherals such as a Network Interface Card (NIC). The PCIe bus is an extended, point-to-point version of the PCI standard, which provides a method for any peripheral connected to the bus to perform Direct Memory Access (DMA), transferring data to and from DRAM without involving an execution core and spending CPU
cycles. The PCI standard includes a configuration mechanism that assigns a range of DRAM to each peripheral, but makes no provisions for restricting a peripheral’s DRAM accesses to its assigned range.

Without any additional protection mechanism, an attacker who comproises system software can take advantage of programable devices to access any DRAM region. 

[1] Rafal Wojtczuk and Joanna Rutkowska. Attacking intel TXT via sinit code execution hijacking, 2011.
The attacker can execute code before the TXT launch, and the attacker’s goal is to either 1) be able to compromise the newly loaded hypervisor, even though is has just been “securely” loaded by TXT (and this is exactly how our previous two attacks worked), or 2) be able to load arbitrary hypervisor, yet make it seem as if it was a trusted one by making all the PCR hashes to be correct. This is how the attack presented today works.

* DRAM Attacks

Rowhammer:
Row hammer (also written as rowhammer) is an unintended and undesirable side effect in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in which memory cells leak their charges and interact electrically between themselves, possibly leaking or changing the contents of nearby memory rows that were not addressed in the original memory access. This bypass of the isolation between DRAM memory cells results from the high cell density in modern DRAM, and can be triggered by specially crafted memory access patterns that rapidly activate the same memory rows numerous times. (Wikipedia)

It took advantage of the fact that some mobile DRAM chips refreshed the DRAM's contents slowly enough that repeatedly changing the contents of the memory cell could impact the charge stored in a neighboring cell, which resulted in changing the bit value obtained from reading the cell. By carefully targeting specific memory addresse, the attacker caused bit flips in the page tables used by the CPU's address translation mechanism, and in other structures used to make security decisions.

* The performance monitoring side channel

Since Intel offers detailed manual about digital temperature and a vast array of performance monitoring events, all these reading are exposed using Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) that can be read by system software.

An attacker who compromises a computer’s system software and gains access to the performance monitoring events or the temperature sensors can obtain the information needed to carry out a power analysis attack, which normally requires physical access to the victim computer
and specialized equipment.

* Attacks on the boot firmware and Intel ME

An attack that compromises the system software can subvert the firmware update mechanism to inject malicious code into the firmware. The malicious code  can be used to carry out a cold boot attack, also it can run code at the highest software privilige level, meanwhile, malicious firmware can modify the system sofware as it is loaded durgin the boot process.

## Address Translation Attacks

* Passive attacks

When the application software does not trust the system software, which is in charge of the page tables.
The system software can be prevented from reading the application's memory directly by placing the application in an isolcated container (i.e., Enclave). However, potentially malicious system software can still infer partial information about the application's memory access patterns, by obeserving the application's page faults and page table attributes.

* Straightforward active attacks

Malicious system software modifies the page tables used by an application in a way that breaks the virtual memory abstraction. 

![construction](https://github.com/Zoeyxiao/paperRelatedRepository/raw/master/Images/example_SAA.png)

The malicious system software directly modifies the page tables of the application inside the container, so the virtual address intended to store the errorOut procedure is actually mapped to a DRAM page that contains the disclose procedure. Without any security measures in place, when the application’s code jumps to the virtual address of the errorOut procedure, the CPU will execute the code of the disclose procedure instead.
